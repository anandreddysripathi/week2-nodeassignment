						Callback
						--------
->A callback is one of the techniques to implement asynchronous property in node js. 
->A callback function, also known as a higher-order function, is a function that is passed as an arguement   to the other function, and the callback function is called  inside the otherFunction so that the callback is   executed.
->When we pass a callback function as an argument to another function, we are only passing the function   definition. We are not executing the function in the parameter.
->The function (callback function) will be called when we declare calling the callback function explicitly. 


A basic program to implement callback function
-------------------------------------
y(c)

function c()
{
  console.log("this is C");
}  
  function y(d)
{
console.log("this is y");
console.log("now i call the callback ");
 d();
}
